#### Neural Network Demystified

Building a Neural Network from Scratch

This contains my own detailed [lecture and lessons](./neural_network_demystified/neural_network_demystified.ipynb) that I have learned from the great and fun lecture series of [Welch Labs](https://www.youtube.com/@WelchLabsVideo) called [Neural Network Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs&list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU&index=1).

The explanations (and formulas) written in markdown hopefully will greatly aid in the understanding of each topic. This has been of value for me as I was writing it, and could be also be of value to anyone reading it.

Let's keep *learning*!
